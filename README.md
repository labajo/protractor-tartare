# Protractor Tartare Framework

This framework allows you to use [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) 
along with [Tartare](https://github.com/telefonicaid/tartare), so you can code tests for your
[AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) application using the BDD/Gherkin syntax provided by Tartare.
